This is a simple Sudoku solver that solves the puzzle like how a human would, until advanced techniques are required. At this point, it employs a recursive backtracking arc consistency algorithm that makes educated guesses until the puzzle is solved.

CSV files with a similar structure should also work

Some additions that could be made:
puzzle generator
GUI
more human-like techniques
step-by-step solution for the user
